# Understanding "private" in TypeScript: Access Modifiers for Class Properties

## Synopsis
The `private` access modifier in TypeScript is used to restrict access to class properties and methods, ensuring that they can only be accessed within the class itself. This is essential for encapsulation and maintaining the integrity of class data.

## Documentation
In TypeScript, access modifiers define the visibility of class members (properties and methods). The `private` modifier limits access to the member, preventing any outside code or derived classes from using it. This is a crucial feature for creating robust and maintainable code, as it allows developers to expose only necessary functionality while keeping the internal workings hidden.

### Purpose
- **Encapsulation**: Protects the internal state of a class by restricting access to its members.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates changes in the class implementation without affecting external code.
- **Clarity**: Makes it clear which members are intended for internal use only.

### Usage
To declare a member as `private`, simply precede it with the `private` keyword in the class definition:

```typescript
class Example {
    private secret: string;

    constructor(secret: string) {
        this.secret = secret;
    }

    private revealSecret(): string {
        return this.secret;
    }
}
```

In the above example, both `secret` and `revealSecret` are private members of the `Example` class.

## Examples
### Basic Example
Here’s a simple example demonstrating the use of the `private` modifier:

```typescript
class Person {
    private name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public getName(): string {
        return this.name; // Allowed: Accessing a private member from within the class
    }
}

const person = new Person("Alice");
console.log(person.getName()); // Output: Alice
// console.log(person.name); // Error: Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
```

### Attempting to Access Private Members
This example illustrates what happens when you try to access a private member from outside the class:

```typescript
class BankAccount {
    private balance: number;

    constructor(initialBalance: number) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public getBalance(): number {
        return this.balance;
    }
}

const account = new BankAccount(1000);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1000
// console.log(account.balance); // Error: Property 'balance' is private and only accessible within class 'BankAccount'.
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Accessing Private Members**: Attempting to access private members from outside the class will result in a compile-time error. Ensure that all interactions with private members occur through public methods.
2. **Inheritance Limitations**: Private members are not accessible in derived classes. If you need to share functionality with subclasses, consider using the `protected` modifier instead.
3. **Misunderstanding of Visibility**: New developers often confuse `public`, `private`, and `protected`. Clarifying these access levels can prevent design flaws.

### Additional Notes
- The `private` modifier is a compile-time feature only; it has no effect on the runtime behavior of JavaScript code generated by TypeScript.
- If you need to share properties with subclasses, consider using `protected` instead of `private`.

## One Line Summary
The `private` access modifier in TypeScript restricts access to class members, enhancing encapsulation and maintaining data integrity.
